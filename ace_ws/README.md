# Autonomous Cell Exploration Framework

This repository contains the codebase for my master's thesis, which presents a framework for autonomous exploration of a robotic cell. The framework integrates:

- Implementation of the proposed exploration planner, **ACEP** (Autonomous Cell Exploration Planner), within the ACE framework.
- **UR5e robot control and integration**
- **MoveIt setup for motion planning**
- - **Gazebo simulation**
- Implementation of a baseline planner based on:  
P. Quin, G. Paul, A. Alempijevic, D. Liu, and G. Dissanayake, "Efficient neighbourhood-based information gain approach for exploration of complex 3D environments," _Autonomous Robots_, vol. 34, no. 2, pp. 133â€“148, Feb. 2013. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10514-013-9325-1

Additionally, the repository includes data from the ablation studies conducted as part of the thesis.

## Purpose
This repository is intended to showcase the implementation and results of my thesis work. While the code demonstrates the methodology used, it is not intended for direct reuse or application without modifications.
